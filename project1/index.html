          <h2>Founder and First Governor-General of Pakistan</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> (26 December 1876 – 11 September 1948)
            was one of the founders of Pakistan. He is also called Baba-e-Qaum,
            which means "the father of the nation" in Urdu. After the
            independence of Pakistan, he became the first Governor-General of
            Pakistan. As a mark of respect, Pakistanis call him Quaid-e-Azam.[2]
            Quaid-e-Azam is a phrase which, in the Urdu language, means "the
            great leader". The day of his birth is a national holiday.In 1894,
            Jinnah quit his job to study law. He joined the course at Lincoln's
            Inn and graduated in 1896. While still in London, he also started to
            participate in politics. He greatly admired Indian political leaders
            Dadabhai Naoroji and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Gradually Jinnah was
            developing his own political outlook. He was thinking on the line
            that India should have a constitutional self-government. Around this
            time, his father lost his business. This put Jinnah under great
            difficulty. In the meantime, he had started to practice as a lawyer
            in Mumbai. He also built a house in Mumbai’s Malabar Hill area. The
            house is now known as Jinnah House. He became a successful lawyer.
            In 1908 he represented Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a famous leader of the
            Indian National Congress. Tilak was facing charges of sedition
            against the British Rule. Jinnah pleaded the case well, but Tilak
            was sent to prison. After that he lost hope.
